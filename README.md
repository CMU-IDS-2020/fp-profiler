### Project setup

The project consists of one back-end and one front-end. You can start a back-end under `backend/` with the following command:
```
flask run
```
This will start a dev server for back-end at localhost:5000.

You can start a front-end under `frontend/profiler/` with the following command:
```
npm install # install all dependencies locally
npm run serve
```
This will start a dev server for this application (front-end) at localhost:8080.
