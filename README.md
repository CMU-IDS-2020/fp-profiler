## Abstract 

Programmers need to keep track of their programs' well-being and optimize the performance of their codes. Profilers are useful tools for experienced programmers to detect CPU bottlenecks and memory errors, but beginners may find it difficult both to use these tools and to interpret the raw text outputs of these tools. In this project, we build a user-friendly visualization for new programmers to conduct both CPU and memory analysis. 

There are three major components. Call graph gives users an overview of the program's structure and also supports free exploration into a small group of functions through expanding and collapsing operations. CPU line-wise panel allows users to detect in detail which lines of the code consumes most time. Memory line-wise panel enables users to detect possible memory bugs in each line of codes. All components are highly interactive and easy to read. Our application is lightweight and end-to-end. Users can spare the trouble of calling profilers and interpretating raw text outputs. All they need to do is to upload their codes or input through the editor.
